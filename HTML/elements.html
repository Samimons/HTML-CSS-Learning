          Represents the root (top-level element) of an HTML document, so it is
          also referred to as the root element. All other elements must be
          descendants of this element.

    <h2>Document metadata</h2>
    <p>
      Metadata contains information about the page. This includes information
      about styles, scripts and data to help software (search engines, browsers,
      etc.) use and render the page. Metadata for styles and scripts may be
      defined in the page or linked to another file that has the information.

        <td>base</td>
        <td>

          There can be only one such element in a document.

        <td>
          Specifies relationships between the current document and an external
          resource. This element is most commonly used to link to CSS but is
          also used to establish site icons (both "favicon" style icons and
          icons for the home screen and apps on mobile devices) among other
          things.

          containing this element.

          a page's tab. It only contains text; HTML tags within the element, if
          any, are also treated as plain text.
