    <h2>Semantics in HTML</h2>
    <p>In HTML, for example, the h1 element is a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of "a top level heading on your page."</p>

    <p>HTML should be coded to represent the data that will be populated and not based on its default presentation styling. Presentation (how it should look), is the sole responsibility of CSS.</p>

    <p>Some of the benefits from writing semantic markup are as follows:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Search engines will consider its contents as important keywords to influence the page's search rankings (see SEO)</li>
        <li>Screen readers can use it as a signpost to help visually impaired users navigate a page</li>
        <li>Finding blocks of meaningful code is significantly easier than searching through endless divs with or without semantic or namespaced classes</li>
        <li>Suggests to the developer the type of data that will be populated</li>
        <li>Semantic naming mirrors proper custom element/component naming</li>
    </ul>

    <p>When approaching which markup to use, ask yourself, "What element(s) best describe/represent the data that I'm going to populate?" For example, is it a list of data?; ordered, unordered?; is it an article with sections and an aside of related information?; does it list out definitions?; is it a figure or image that needs a caption?; should it have a header and a footer in addition to the global site-wide header and footer?; etc.</p>
