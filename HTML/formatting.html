    <h2>Formatting Elements</h2>
    <p>Formatting elements were designed to display special types of text:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="highlightedCode">&ltb&gt</span> - element is used to draw
        the reader's attention to the element's contents, which are not
        otherwise granted special importance.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlightedCode">&ltstrong&gt</span> - element indicates
        that its contents have strong importance, seriousness, or urgency.
        Browsers typically render the contents in bold type.
      </li>
      <li><span class="highlightedCode">&lti&gt</span> - element represents a range of text that is set off from the normal text for some reason, such as idiomatic text, technical terms, taxonomical designations, among others. Historically, these have been presented using italicized type, which is the original source of the <i> naming of this element.</li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlightedCode">&ltem&gt</span> - element marks text that has stress emphasis. The <em> element can be nested, with each level of nesting indicating a greater degree of emphasis.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlightedCode">&ltmark&gt</span> - element represents text which is marked or highlighted for reference or notation purposes due to the marked passage's relevance in the enclosing context.
      <li>
        <span class="highlightedCode">&ltsmall&gt</span> - element represents side-comments and small print, like copyright and legal text, independent of its styled presentation. By default, it renders text within it one font-size smaller, such as from small to x-small.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlightedCode">&ltdel&gt</span> - element represents a range of text that has been deleted from a document.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlightedCode">&ltins&gt</span> - element represents a range of text that has been added to a document
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlightedCode">&ltsub&gt</span> - element specifies inline text which should be displayed as subscript for solely typographical reasons. Subscripts are typically rendered with a lowered baseline using smaller text.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="highlightedCode">&ltsup&gt</span> - element specifies inline text which is to be displayed as superscript for solely typographical reasons. Superscripts are usually rendered with a raised baseline using smaller text.
      </li>
    </ul>
