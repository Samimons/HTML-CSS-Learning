    <!-- Font Family -->
    <h2>font-family</h2>
    <p>
      The font-family CSS property specifies a prioritized list of one or more
      font family names and/or generic family names for the selected element.
    </p>
    <p>
      The browser starts at the beginning of the list and looks to see if that
      font is available on the machine. If it is, it applies that font to the
      selected elements. If not, it moves on to the next font, and so on.
    </p>

    <img src="../images/fontFamily.png" height="25" alt="CSS code" />

    <p>
      It is a good idea to provide a suitable generic font name at the end of
      the stack so that if none of the listed fonts are available, the browser
      can at least provide something approximately suitable. To emphasize this
      point, paragraphs are given the browser's default serif font if no other
      option is available — which is usually Times New Roman — this is no good
      for a sans-serif font!
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>serif - Fonts that have serifs (the flourishes and other small details you see at the ends of the strokes in some typefaces).</li>
        <li>sans-serif - Fonts that don't have serifs.</li>
        <li>monospace - Fonts where every character has the same width, typically used in code listings.</li>
        <li>cursive	- Fonts that are intended to emulate handwriting, with flowing, connected strokes.</li>
        <li>fantasy	- Fonts that are intended to be decorative.</li>
        <li>math - This is for the particular stylistic concerns of representing mathematics: superscript and subscript, brackets that cross several lines, nesting expressions, and double struck glyphs with distinct meanings.</li>
        <li>emoji - Fonts that are specifically designed to render emoji.</li>
        <li>fangsong - A particular style of Chinese characters that are between serif-style Song and cursive-style Kai forms. This style is often used for government documents.</li>
    </ul>
<hr>



<!-- Font Size -->
<h2>font-size</h2>
<p>The font-size CSS property sets the size of the font. Changing the font size also updates the sizes of the font size-relative <length> units, such as em, ex, and so forth.</p>
<img src="../images/fontSize.png" height="700" alt="CSS code">
<hr>



<!-- Font Weights -->
<h2>font-weight</h2>
<p>The font-weight CSS property sets the weight (or boldness) of the font. The weights available depend on the font-family that is currently set.</p>
<img src="../images/font-weight.png" height="600" alt="CSS code">

<h3>Common weight name mapping</h3>
<p>The numerical values 100 to 900 roughly correspond to the following common weight names.</p>
<img src="../images/commonWeightNameMapping.png" height="400" alt="CSS code">
<hr>



<!-- Font Style -->
<h2>font-style</h2>
<p>The font-style CSS property sets whether a font should be styled with a normal, italic, or oblique face from its font-family.</p>
<img src="../images/fontStyle.png" height="300" alt="CSS code">
<p>normal
Selects a font that is classified as normal within a font-family.</p>
<p>italic
Selects a font that is classified as italic. If no italic version of the face is available, one classified as oblique is used instead. If neither is available, the style is artificially simulated.</p>
<p>oblique
Selects a font that is classified as oblique. If no oblique version of the face is available, one classified as italic is used instead. If neither is available, the style is artificially simulated.</p>
<p>oblique <angle>
Selects a font classified as oblique, and additionally specifies an angle for the slant of the text. If one or more oblique faces are available in the chosen font family, the one that most closely matches the specified angle is chosen. If no oblique faces are available, the browser will synthesize an oblique version of the font by slanting a normal face by the specified amount. Valid values are degree values of -90deg to 90deg inclusive. If an angle is not specified, an angle of 14 degrees is used. Positive values are slanted to the end of the line, while negative values are slanted towards the beginning.</p>
<p></p>
<hr>



<!-- Text Align -->
<h2>text-align</h2>
<p>The text-align CSS property sets the horizontal alignment of the inline-level content inside a block element or table-cell box.</p>
<img src="../images/textAlign.png" height="500" alt="CSS code">
<hr>



<!-- Letter Spacing, Word Spacing -->
<h2>letter-spacing & word-spacing</h2>
<p>The letter-spacing CSS property sets the horizontal spacing behavior between text characters. This value is added to the natural spacing between characters while rendering the text. Positive values of letter-spacing causes characters to spread farther apart, while negative values of letter-spacing bring characters closer together.</p>
<img src="../images/letterSpacing.png" height="300" alt="CSS code">
<img src="../images/wordSpacing.png" height="300" alt="CSS code">
<hr>



<!-- Line Height -->
<h2>line-height</h2>
<p>The line-height CSS property sets the height of a line box in horizontal writing modes. In vertical writing modes, it sets the width of a line box. It's commonly used to set the distance between lines of text. On block-level elements in horizontal writing modes, it specifies the preferred height of line boxes within the element, and on non-replaced inline elements, it specifies the height that is used to calculate line box height.</p>
<img src="../images/lineHeight.png" height="450" alt="CSS code">
<p>normal - 
Depends on the user agent. Desktop browsers (including Firefox) use a default value of roughly 1.2, depending on the element's font-family.</p>
<p>number -  (unitless)
The used value is this unitless number multiplied by the element's own font size. The computed value is the same as the specified number. In most cases, this is the preferred way to set line-height and avoid unexpected results due to inheritance.</p>
<p>length - 
The specified length is used in the calculation of the line box height. Values given in em units may produce unexpected results (see example below).</p>
<p>percentage - 
Relative to the font size of the element itself. The computed value is this percentage multiplied by the element's computed font size. Percentage values may produce unexpected results.</p>
<hr>



<!-- Custom Fonts -->
<h2>custom fonts</h2>
<p>Take me to <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a></p>
<ol>
    <li>Select font.</li>
    <li>Click "Get font, top right"</li>
    <li>Click "Get embedded code"</li>
    <li>Copy embedded code and put in head of html.</li>
</ol>
<p>Which will look something like this:
</p>
<img src="../images/googleFonts.png" height="80" alt="">
<hr>



<!-- Text Shadow -->
 <h2>text-shadow</h2>
<p>The text-shadow CSS property adds shadows to text. It accepts a comma-separated list of shadows to be applied to the text and any of its decorations. Each shadow is described by some combination of X and Y offsets from the element, blur radius, and color.</p>
<img src="../images/textShadow.png" height="500" alt="CSS code">
<h3>Values</h3>
<p>offset-x offset-y
Required. These length values specify the shadow's distance from the text. offset-x specifies the horizontal distance; a negative value places the shadow to the left of the text. offset-y specifies the vertical distance; a negative value places the shadow above the text. If both values are 0, the shadow is placed directly behind the text, although it may be partly visible due to the effect of blur-radius.</p>
<p>blur-radius
Optional. This is a length value. The higher the value, the bigger the blur; the shadow becomes wider and lighter. If not specified, it defaults to 0.</p>
<p>color
Optional. The color of the shadow. It can be specified either before or after the offset values. If unspecified, the color's value is left up to the user agent, so when consistency across browsers is desired you should define it explicitly.</p>
<hr>




<!-- Text Transform -->
<h2>text-transform</h2>
<p>The text-transform CSS property specifies how to capitalize an element's text. It can be used to make text appear in all-uppercase or all-lowercase, or with each word capitalized. It also can help improve legibility for ruby.</p>
<img src="../images/textTransform .png" height="350" alt="CSS code">
<p>uppercase
Is a keyword that converts all characters to uppercase.</p>
<p>lowercase
Is a keyword that converts all characters to lowercase.</p>
<p>none
Is a keyword that prevents the case of all characters from being changed.</p>
<p>full-width
Is a keyword that forces the writing of a character — mainly ideograms and Latin scripts — inside a square, allowing them to be aligned in the usual East Asian scripts (like Chinese or Japanese).</p>
<p>full-size-kana
Generally used for ruby annotation text, the keyword converts all small Kana characters to the equivalent full-size Kana, to compensate for legibility issues at the small font sizes typically used in ruby.</p>
<p>math-auto
Used to automatically render text in math italic where appropriate. It transforms Latin and Greek letters, and a few other math-related symbols, to italic mathematical symbols but only if it's applied on a text node containing a single character. For example, "x" will become "𝑥" (U+1D465), but "exp" will stay as "exp". It is primarily used to specify the behavior of mi elements in MathML. You should generally use MathML markup which automatically applies the right styling.</p>
<hr>



<!-- Text Decoration -->
<h2>text-decoration</h2>
<p>The text-decoration shorthand CSS property sets the appearance of decorative lines on text. It is a shorthand for text-decoration-line, text-decoration-color, text-decoration-style, and the newer text-decoration-thickness property.</p>
<img src="../images/textDecoration.png" height="400" alt="CSS code">
<p>text-decoration-thickness: 10px;</p>
<p>text-decoration-line
Sets the kind of decoration used, such as underline or line-through.</p>
<p>text-decoration-color
Sets the color of the decoration.</p>
<p>text-decoration-style
Sets the style of the line used for the decoration, such as solid, wavy, or dashed.</p>
<p>text-decoration-thickness
Sets the thickness of the line used for the decoration.</p>
<hr>



<!-- List Style -->
 <h2>list-style</h2>
 <p>The list-style CSS shorthand property allows you to set all the list style properties at once.</p>
<p>The values of this property are applied to list items, including li elements and elements with display: list-item;. Because this property is inherited, it can be set on a parent element (normally ol or ul) to make the same list styling apply to all the nested items.</p>

<img src="../images/listStyles.png" height="500" alt="CSS code">

<p>list-style-type
A counter-style, string, or none. If omitted in the shorthand, the default disc value is used. See list-style-type.</p>
<p>list-style-image
An image or none. If omitted, the default none value is used. See list-style-image.</p>
<p>list-style-position
Either inside or outside. If omitted, the default outside value is used. See list-style-position.</p>
<p>none
No list style is used.</p>
<hr>



<!-- Styling Links -->
<h2>styling-links</h2>
<p>When styling links, it is important to understand why default link styles are important, how to use pseudo-classes to style link states effectively, and how to style links for use in common varied interface features such as navigation menus and tabs.</p>
<h3>Link states</h3>

<p>link: A link that has a destination (i.e., not just a named anchor), styled using the :link pseudo class.</p>
<p>visited: A link that has already been visited (exists in the browser's history), styled using the :visited pseudo class.</p>
<p>hover: A link that is hovered over by a user's mouse pointer, styled using the :hover pseudo class.</p>
<p>focus: A link that is focused (e.g., moved to by a keyboard user using the Tab key or something similar, or programmatically focused using HTMLElement.focus()) %E2%80%94 this is styled using the :focus pseudo class.</p>
<p>active: A link that is activated (e.g., clicked on), styled using the :active pseudo class.</p>

<h3>Default styles</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Links are underlined.</li>
  <li>Unvisited links are blue.</li>
  <li>Visited links are purple.</li>
  <li>Hovering a link makes the mouse pointer change to a little hand icon.</li>
  <li>Focused links have an outline around them — you should be able to focus on the links on this page with the keyboard by pressing the tab key.</li>
  <li>Active links are red. Try holding down the mouse button on the link as you click it.</li>
</ul>
<hr>



<!-- Styling links as buttons -->
<h2>Styling links as buttons</h2>
<p>In addition, links are quite commonly styled to look and behave like buttons in certain circumstances. A website navigation menu can be marked up as a set of links, and this can be styled to look like a set of control buttons or tabs that provide the user with access to other parts of the site.</p>
<p>HTML</p>
<img src="../images/stylingLinksHTML.png" height="150" alt="HTML code">


<p>CSS</p>
<img src="../images/stylingLinks.png" height="500" alt="">


<nav class="container">
  <a class="lab" href="lab">Home</a>
  <a class="lab" href="lab">Pizza</a>
  <a class="lab" href="lab">Music</a>
  <a class="lab" href="lab">Wombats</a>
  <a class="lab" href="lab">Finland</a>
</nav>

<p>The HTML defines a nav element with a "container" class. The nav contains our links.</p>
<p>The CSS includes the styling for the container and the links it contains.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The second rule says:</li><ul>
    <li>The container is a flexbox. The items it contains — the links, in this case — will be flex items.</li>
    <li>The gap between the flex items will be 0.625% of the container's width.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>The third rule styles the links:</li><ul>
    <li>The first declaration, flex: 1, means that the widths of the items will be adjusted so they use all the available space in the container.</li>
    <li>Next, we turn off the default text-decoration and outline — we don't want those spoiling our look.</li>
    <li>The last three declarations are to center the text inside each link, set the line-height to 3 to give the buttons some height (which also has the advantage of centering the text vertically), and set the text color to black.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<hr>




<!-- Cursor -->
 <h2>cursor</h2>
 <p>The cursor CSS property sets the mouse cursor, if any, to show when the mouse pointer is over an element.</p>
 <p>The cursor setting should inform users of the mouse operations that can be performed at the current location, including: text selection, activating help or context menus, copying content, resizing tables, and so on. You can specify either the type of cursor using a keyword, or load a specific icon to use (with optional fallback images and mandatory keyword as a final fallback).</p>
